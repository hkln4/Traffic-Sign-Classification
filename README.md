# Traffic-Sign-Classification

This project presents an advanced implementation of traffic sign classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the “valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed” dataset, a preprocessed collection of traffic sign images, each standardized to 32x32 pixels with three RGB channels. Data preprocessing begins with loading the dataset from pickle files, followed by reshaping the image tensors to conform to the standard input shape required by the neural network. Label data is one-hot encoded using TensorFlow’s to_categorical() method, enabling efficient multi-class classification.

The CNN architecture is constructed using a sequential model, comprising multiple convolutional layers that extract hierarchical spatial features from the images. These convolutional layers are interleaved with pooling layers (MaxPooling2D), which progressively reduce the spatial dimensions while retaining essential features. Regularization techniques, including dropout and batch normalization, are integrated to prevent overfitting and stabilize the training process. The network’s fully connected (dense) layers further refine the extracted features, leading to a final softmax output layer, which produces probability distributions for each of the 43 traffic sign classes.

Training is optimized using the Adam optimizer, with an adaptive learning rate scheduler to ensure efficient convergence without oscillations. Model evaluation is based on accuracy, assessed on a separate test set, providing a clear measure of classification performance. The project demonstrates a sophisticated application of deep learning in the context of image classification, highlighting the potential of convolutional neural networks for reliable real-time recognition of traffic signs.
